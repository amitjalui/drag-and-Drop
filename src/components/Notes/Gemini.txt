Card.jsx:

When a card is dragged over another card:
The handleDragEnter function is triggered, setting the isDraggingOver state to true.
The onHover prop is called with the card ID (id) and true (indicating hovering) to notify the Grid component.
Grid.jsx:

When handleCardHover receives the hover information from Card.jsx:
If hovering (isHovering is true):
The card ID is added to the hoveredCards state array using setHoveredCards.
The currentHoveredCards state is updated with the current hovered card ID.
If not hovering (isHovering is false):
The card ID is removed from the hoveredCards state array if it was previously present.
The className attribute in the grid's JSX leverages currentHoveredCards along with isDraggingOver to conditionally apply the "hovered" class only when the dragged card is over a specific card.
When the user hovers their mouse over a card (not dragging):
handleMouseEnter applies the "hovered" class directly to the card's element.
handleMouseLeave removes the "hovered" class when the mouse leaves the card.
Console Output:

The console.log statement inside handleCardHover (with isHovering as true) will print the ID of the card being hovered over when a card is dragged.
This allows you to verify that the hovering information is being correctly transmitted and tracked.

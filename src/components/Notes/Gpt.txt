Of course! Let's walk through the flow of events that occurs when a card is dragged and hovered over other cards in your grid layout:

Initial Drag Start:

When the user starts dragging a card, the handleDragStart function is triggered in the Card component.
This function sets the data transfer data (cardId) for the dragged card, which will be used to identify the card being dragged.
Drag Enter:

As the dragged card enters the space of another card, the handleDragEnter function is triggered in the Card component.
This function sets the isDraggingOver state to true to indicate that the dragged card is currently hovering over another card.
It also triggers the onHover function provided by the Grid component, passing the ID of the hovered card and true to indicate that the card is being hovered over.
Drag Leave:

If the dragged card leaves the space of a hovered card, the handleDragLeave function is triggered in the Card component.
This function sets a delay before handling the hover state, allowing for a short time to determine if the dragged card will re-enter another card's space.
If the dragged card doesn't re-enter another card's space within the delay time, the onHover function is triggered with false to indicate that the card is no longer being hovered over.
Drag Over:

While the dragged card is hovering over another card, the handleDragOver function in the Card component prevents the default behavior, ensuring that the dragEnter and dragLeave events are handled accurately.
State Management:

The hoveredCards state in the Grid component maintains a list of IDs of the cards currently being hovered over by the dragged card.
When a card is hovered over (isHovering is true), its ID is added to the hoveredCards state. When it stops being hovered over, its ID is removed from the state.
Logging and Feedback:

The currentHoveredCards state in the Grid component keeps track of the ID of the card currently being hovered over by the dragged card.
This state is logged to the console for debugging purposes, providing feedback on which card the dragged card is currently hovering over.


------------


=> When user starts dragging a card, handleDragStart triggered.
handleDragStart(
  return cardId // set cardId
)

=> When user dragged card enters the space of another card, handleDragEnter triggered.
handleDragEnter (
  isDraggingOver(true)  // useState
  onHover(id, true) // func from Grid
)
indicate that the dragged card is currently hovering over another card.

=> When user dragged card leaves the space of a hovered card, handleDragLeave triggered.
handleDragLeave (
  setTimeout(onHover(id, false)) after 200ms
)
sets a delay before handling the onHover state false, allowing for a short time to determine if the dragged card will re-enter another card's space.

=> handleDragOver ()
prevent events are handled accurately.
